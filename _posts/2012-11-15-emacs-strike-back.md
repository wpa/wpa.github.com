A long long (1998/99) time ago I was starting my adventure with *Unix* systems.
Because all is a file I had to choose my text editor. First one was *"ed"* a line editor. Well, each system has it but even then it was outdated. Second shoot was the vi/vim editor. My first contact with it just end with reset button. Emacs was next... Well, shortcuts and modes it was too much for me. I've returned to vim and I was stucked:)
 
Yesterday I was searching a IDE/editor with REPL for Clojure. Eclipse? Hmm, I want something new. Lisp is a grandma of Clojure, so is Emacs my new hope?
